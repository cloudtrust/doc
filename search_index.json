source error traking software that publishes errors and logs to a network server. It's website states that one should \"Stop hoping that users will report errors\". \nSentry allows for an integration with a large number of platforms, including Java, the language used in Keycloak, Their usage documentation states that while it is possible to use Sentry manually, it is highly recommended to use one of the provided integrations. These integrations are basically common frameworks like Android of Spring, or popular logging engines such as log4j, Logback or JUL.\nImplementation in Sentry\nThe installation of Sentry is beyond the scope of this document. But once it is installaled and correctly set up, simply:\n\nCreate a new project\nSelect java from choice of framework, and select a project name (for example keycloak)\nGo to your new project and open the project settings\nGo to the Client Keys (DSN) section.\nNote the DSN, This value will later have to be entered in keycloak's configuration.\n\nImplementation in Keycloak\nOf the loggers supported by Sentry, Keycloak supports, via jboss, log4j, log4j2 and JUL, as seen in org.jboss.logging, but by defaut log4j seems to be used. The Sentry documentation for log4j states that a specific appender, io.sentry.log4j.SentryAppender must be used to send the information to Sentry.\nIn Keycloak this basically means:\n\nAdding the sentry and sentry-log4j libraries to Keycloak modules. Any loaded module can be used, including one specifically for Sentry (in which case do not forget to add the sentry module to the layers.conf).\nAdding the appender to the standalone.xml (or configuration xml used).\nAdding the Sentry DSN (basically the address of the Sentry server) to the same configuration file as a Java system property. There are other methods to do this (such as using a system environment, see relevent documentation), but the system property is the best for Keycloak,\n\nThe directory structure is the following, where the base directory is the base directory of the module (in our case /modules/system/layers/sentry):\n.\n`-- io\n    `-- sentry\n        |-- log4j\n        |   `-- main\n        |       |-- module.xml\n        |       `-- sentry-log4j-1.6.3.jar\n        `-- main\n            |-- module.xml\n            `-- sentry-1.6.3.jar\nThe module.xml for the base sentry jar is as follows:\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nAnd for the sentry-log4j;\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThe rest of the configuration can be done by running the following three lines in a connected jboss-cli, all three of which simply modify the configuration xml (standalone.xml in our case).\nTo set the defintion for the SentryAppender:\n/subsystem=logging/custom-handler=sentry:add(name=sentry,class=io.sentry.log4j.SentryAppender,module=io.sentry.log4j,enabled=true,formatter=PATTERN,level=WARN)\nThis adds the following lines to the configuration\n...\n    \n        \n        ...\n        \n                \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            ...\n\nTo add the SentryAppender to the root logger:\n/subsystem=logging/root-logger=ROOT:add-handler(name=sentry)\nThis adds the following lines to the configuration\n...\n            \n                \n                \n                    ...\n                    \n                \n            \n            ...\n\nTo add the DSN to as a system property:\n/system-property=sentry.dsn:add()\nThis adds the following lines to the configuration\n\n...\n    \n        \n    \n    ...\n\n"},"chapter-keycloak/storage.html":{"url":"chapter-keycloak/storage.html","title":"Storage","keywords":"","body":"Keycloak Storage\nThis chapter contains the principals of  keycloak storage.\nCreating the database structure in Keycloak\nAs long as an initial database is created, keycloak will be able to automatically create its initial state (tables, indexes, constants, etc...), without needing a administrator to run SQL scripts. It does this through the use of Liquibase. The use of Liquibase also allows the database to be automatically modified when upgrading to a new version of Keycloak.\nAbout Liquibase\nFull documentation may be found on Liquibase's website, but the basic principal is the following: changes to the database are recorded within Database change logs, XML files that contain the instructions for manipulating the database. One can for example create tables, delete tables, maniuplate column, indexes, constraints, etc... The philosophy is to create a set of one or more of such database change logs for every new release, and therefore no matter what version you are at, Liquibase can update from your current status to the new one.\nIn order to know which files have been run, and therefore which files to run in the event of an upgade, liquibase creates itself the databasechangelog table which records which changelogs have run, and the \nAn important note is that liquibase uses the jdbc driver to determine which database is actually being used when applying the commands in the XML files to the database. When databases reuse drivers from another database, which is for example the case for cockroachdb. However, this means that the transformation Liquibase does from XML â†’ SQL may be imperfect. \nUse of Liquibase in Keycloak\nIn Keycloak all database changelog files can be found at model/jpa/src/main/resources/META-INF. The main file is jpa-changelog-master.xml which contains the list of all database change files to call, and the order in which they are called. Running Keycloak or its unit tests that access the DB will automatically run the master changelog, if necessary.\nCockroachDB\nIn this chapter we will discuss the methods with which support for CockroachDB was added to Keycloak.\nDatabase schema creation\nKeycloak uses Liquibase to create the database schema and all constants (see Creating the database).  Liquibase supports PostgreSQL, but not directly CockroachDB. However, since CockroachDB uses the PostgreSQL jdbc driver and supports the syntax, Liquibase is mostly compable with CockroachDB.\nHowever, there are quite a few notable exceptions to this compatibility, and they arise when Keycloak's \"normal\" database changelogs are used. To correct the problem, a new set of changelogs specifically for CockroachDB are generated, mostely using the ChangeLogEditor - a java tool developped specifcally for this purpose.\nThe following subsections list the incompatibilities between the Keycloak changelogs and CockroachDB, and the modifications made.\nAdding primary keys\nIn CockroachDB primary keys must be created with the tables and cannot be manipulated afterwards, but in the Keycloak changelogs the operation is always seperate. To correct this, the syntax is modified to group the creation of primary keys in the create table instruction.\nHowever, in a few cases (about 8), \"primary columns\" are removed, and a new key is added. Since the table generation is in another file, in this case:\n\nA new table is created with the correct structure\nThe contents are copied from the old table to the new table\nThe old table is dropped\nThe new table is renamed to the correct table name. \n\nAdding foreign keys\nForeign keys can be added and removed without problem in CockroachDB, however the column(s) MUST have a index defined on it. The solution creates indexes on all columns in a new changelog (to avoid precedence problems), and moves all \"add foreign keys\" to a third column (for the same reason.\nRemoving unique constraints\nIn CockroachDB altering a table to add a unique constraint in fact creates a unique index, and adds an entry to the list of constraints. And in fact creating a unique index does exactly the same thing, meaning that the two are interchangable. However, while it is possible to drop a unique index (which also drops the contraint), the CockRoachDB does not allow the syntax to drop the constraint. \nThe modification changes all instances of \"drop unique constraint\" to \"drop uinique index\".\nActivities that must or should be done\nThis TODO list can be editied as the following tasks are resolved:\n\nOnly create indexes for foreign keys when one does not already exist\nRemove indexes created for foreign keys when they are removed\nPush a modification to CockroachDB to ensure that \"remove unique contraint\" acts like \"remove unique index\"\n\n"},"chapter-keycloak/protocol.html":{"url":"chapter-keycloak/protocol.html","title":"Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Keycloak Protocol\nThis chapter contains the principals of keycloak's protocol implementation.

It comes with lots of moving parts and can be overwhelming to understand at first.\nHere we explore the important bits that everyone should understand, and how they relate to cloudtrust.\nInternal components\nKubectl\nkubectl is the client program that connects to kubernetes and sends commands. It's a glorified wrapper over curl (just use -v9 as an option when running any command and it will show the curl command that will yield the same result).\nKubelet\nThe kubelet is a daemon running on every node that provides an API able to get information on that node. It's mostly a bridge for various docker/systems related tasks.\nIt's the component in charge of running containers, creating volumes, etc...\nAPI-Server\nThe kube-apiserver can be considered the kubernetes \"master\". Like its name suggests, it is in charge on the entire kubernetes api. Every call from the kubectl ends at an apiserver, and every kubernetes-related component is aware of at least one such master. Since kubernetes is meant for distributed workloads, the apiserver can be scaled out. As such, it stores all its data in a distributed KV store (etcd)\nScheduler\nThe kube-scheduler is in charge of scheduling containers onto nodes. It registers to the apiserver, which will send it specs of containers to run and the general state of the cluster. The scheduler can be distributed too, and does leader election through the apiserver\nController Manager\nThe kube-controller-manager is in charge of all control loops in kubernetes. For instance, changing the number of replicas in a replication controller will cause the kube-controller-manager to update its desired state, and then act on the apiserver to work towards that state. It does leader election through the apiserver.\nProxy\nThe kube-proxy is responsible for all the routing between kubernetes nodes\nExternal components\nOverlay2 filesystem\nWe use the overlay2 fs as our layered filesystem. We did not do in depth comparison of various storage drivers. This might come later\nOverlay2 is very simple and performs well and has been picked for these reasons\nDocker\nDocker is our container engine of choice. It is in charge of spawning containers from images. Not much more. It is only accessible locally by talking to its unix socket.\nFlannel\nContainers live in their (shared) network namespace, so they can communicate with one another using their IP addresses and such. Containers across different hosts however, cannot. Flannel is a daemon that provides an overlay network that all containers can share. Internally, it works by setting and maintaining vxlan interfaces accross all nodes. It synchronizes using etcd as a distributed KV store.\nEtcd\netcd is a distributed KV store used by the kube-apiserver and flannel.\nHow it all interacts\n\nTypical structure of a kubernetes node\nA kubernetes node typically has 3 things going on to connect it to the rest of the Ecosystem. Each node should be thought of as belonging to 3 networks, each maintained differently.\n\n1: The Flannel IP. Each node joining the cluster is assigned a unique flannel range that is a subrange of the cluster's range. (ie, if the cluster range is 10.244.0.0/16, a node A's range could be 10.244.23.0/24, and node B 10.244.52.0/24). Flannel operates by creating a virtual network interface that is used to route traffic to the other nodes using vxlan.\nContainers are assigned IPs from the flannel range by the docker daemon, which is made aware of the network by getting parameters from a file generated by flannel on cluster-join. The default bridge ip becomes flannel's node range.\n\n2: The Cluster IP. Kubernetes cluster can define a cluster IP for kubernetes managed services. Using this mechanism, we can expose a postgresql service on ip 10.254.10.223, which will point to the postgresql containers IPs. This is kept up to date by the kube-proxy, which watches updates to the apiserver and modifies iptables NAT rules accordingly. The cluster IP does not have an interface. Cluster IP backends are NOT currently load-balanced. So if a service links to multiple containers, each kube-proxy will pick a backend in a round-robin fashion and not change it until the container goes down. This provides a very primitive form of load-balancing, but is unsatisfactory.\n\n3: The node's IP. This is the public IP of the node, and the only real NIC the node should need\n\n\n"},"chapter-deploy/Docker.html":{"url":"chapter-deploy/Docker.html","title":"Docker","keywords":"","body":"Intro to Linux containers\nLinux containers are sets of processes isolated from the rest of the ecosystem. In essence, containers abstract away the kernel like VMs do with the hardware. This is possible via a number of kernel mechanisms, but most importantly, namespaces and cgroups.\nContainers are made of 3 components: Namespaces, Cgroups and an Overlay filesystem. I am not going to delve into them, as there is a lot of great documentation already out there. Instead I am going to focus on Docker specifics, since that's what we use for Cloudtrust, and especially how we use it.\nFor a good overview on what makes containers possible on Linux, I recommend these articles : \n\nhttps://lwn.net/Articles/531114/\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/cgroups.txt\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/anatomy-of-a-container-namespaces-cgroups-some-filesystem-magic-linuxcon\n\nFor a good intro to docker :\n\nhttps://nschoe.com/articles/2016-05-26-Docker-Taming-the-Beast-Part-1.html\n\nDocker in Cloudtrust\nIn Cloudtrust, our containers don't follow the guidelines by the docker team for practical reasons. We run multiple processes per container, which leads to having to run an init system as PID 1 in our containers. This helps out debugging and initial testing as we can edit configuration files at will and restart services inside the container with updated configuration, without having to rebuild/redeploy everything.\nFurthermore, an init system is a great asset when trying to initialize containers (like create users, etc...), and is outright indispensable when a single service is made of multiple processes ( keycloak + keycloak_bridge ).\nOur containers all follow the same schema for buildup:\n\nbase image: This image contains the git keys to pull from repos, as well as some system utilities. It installs git, systemd and the likes.\ncomponent image: This image installs a component and its dependencies (for instance keycloak and its bridge and its modules), and usually comes with a plethora of arguments to shape it. Typical arguments are \nconfig_repository and git_tag : An application needs configuration, those are stored (for now) on a git server, those parameters specify the repository and the tag/commit hash of what to pull.\nservice_git_tag : The dockerfile should be explicit about what commit it is issued from! So instead of ADDing the common configuration, we git clone it instead.\nservice_url : Sometimes a component depends on other components, and the dockerfile must fetch them. This is the url at which it will find the binaries to run.\n\n\n\nSystemd In Containers\nSystemd is a widely used Linux init system. It expects to be running as PID 1 and have full control over the system. Thankfully, a lot of work has been put into it to make it runnable inside an unprivileged container. This however requires that :\n\n/tmp is a tmpfs\n/run is a tmpfs\n/sys/fs/cgroup is mounted and is readable\nDocker run commands need to have the following flags : --tmpfs /tmp, --tmpfs /run and -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro.\n\nFurthermore, since systemd attempts to read cgroups, selinux needs to let that happen. So the selinux boolean container_manage_cgroups needs to be set to true\n"},"chapter-deploy/Kubernetes.html":{"url":"chapter-deploy/Kubernetes.html","title":"Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"Kubernetes in Cloudtrust\nKubernetes' purpose is to define the cluster's desired state through yaml files, and then apply those files.\nEssentially, this means specifying what containers to run, in how many replicas, where (to some extent). It allows us to treat a bunch of machines as a single one.\nKubernetes isn't inherently complex, but it has many different parts and a lot of small behaviour quirks, and it can feel overwhelming to a beginner. This section attempts to demistify all of the fluff of kubernetes that cloudtrust uses.\nDefining resources\nKubernetes understands all resource definition through yaml files. For a complete reference refer to : https://v1-7.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.7/\nPods\nPods in kubernetes is simply a set of containers that share a few namespaces. Namely Network and PID by default.\n\nWarning In our case, where we run systemd in our containers, PID namespace sharing has to be disabled!! This is due to the fact that kubernetes runs a pause initialization container to initialize the common namespace for containers in the pod. This pause program gets PID 1 and systemd refuses to run!\n\nPods aren't meant to be manipulated directly. Just like we used to run container by starting them in a systemd unit file, we want kubernetes to restart pods when they fail. So pods aren't used in cloudtrust, except for one category of pods.\nStatic Pods\nRemember that kubernetes has 5 components that run on a master node, and 2 that run on every slave. Among those, the kubelet and kube-proxy have to run on the host, as one runs containers and the other manages iptables rules. The 3 master components, however, can run inside containers. But running containers that won't be managed by kubernetes among a whole ecosystem of containers can be foolish (To understand that, simply run a docker ps on a kubernetes node, and try to find the containers you've run by hand). To this end, kubernetes provides a mechanism to run static pods. Static pods are kubernetes pods that are launched by the kubelet without interaction with the Apiserver. To define static pods, we have to provide a directory that the kubelet watches for changes and write manifests inside. This is a great way to run master components (apiserver, scheduler, controller-manager, etcd...) in containers and see them through kubernetes.\nDeployments\nKubernetes pods are ephemeral and not very useful on their own, as they can't scale up or down easily. The answer to this problem is deployments. Deployments allow us to specify a number of expected replicas, and come with nice rolling update features. When a deployment is created, it automatically spawns a replicaset controller, which specifies the desired state in the controller manager. This will ensure that X replicas are always running (if possible).\nService\nOnce containers are spawned, it's important to make them accessible. One way to do so is to use a kubernetes Service. Services are basically a wrapper around pods that allow them to be exposed either through a ClusterIP or a NodePort. A ClusterIP service is just that, a Cluster IP that will be forwarded to one of the services' backend pod (note that this doesn't provide any real load balancing!!), while a NodePort is essentially a port on any node that will forward to one of the services backends (again, no load balancing there!). Services by themselves are pretty useless, but shine when used in conjunction with a cluster DNS.\nDNS\nA cluster DNS is a pod with a fixed ClusterIP that provides name resolution for the cluster. It is composed of 4 parts:\n\nService: The server needs a known IP which is reachable inside the cluster both by nodes and by containers. Furthermore it needs to be deterministic. To this end, the service IP is a fixed Cluster IP, fixed to 10.254.0.10 (where 10.254.0.0/16 is the cluster IP range)\nServiceAccount: The DNS needs access to the kubernetes API, and uses a service account for that\nConfigMap: The DNS has a configmap available in case we need to change the configuration dynamically. It needs to be initialized to give upstream servers so that cluster components have regular name resolution as well as cluster.\nDeployment: The DNS deployment is made of 3 different containers. One is the kube-dns container, that listens to the apiserver for new services. It dynamically updates its configuration and acts as a secondary DNS for the 2nd container: dnsmasq. A third container provides healthchecking for the pod. The only parameter required is by the kube-dns and is simply the cluster name.\n\nIngress Controller\nOnce we have services and name resolution for services, pods within the cluster can communicate with one another, but nothing can come from the outside. This would typically be the job of a reverse proxy like nginx or haproxy, but those wouldn't be able to dynamically load configuration from the apiserver. This is where ingress controllers come in. An Ingress controller is basically a wrapper over an existing reverse proxy, that is also able to dynamically change its configuration. We use the nginx ingress controller.\nIngress Rules\nOne a controller is defined, we need to feed it with rules regarding hostnames and what service they map to. This is the job of Ingress Rules.\n\nHint To update an SSL certificate, we need to create a kubernetes secret of type \"tls\" using this syntax : kubectl create secret tls foo-secret --key /tmp/tls.key --cert /tmp/tls.crt\n\n\n\nHint To test an https connection with host based routing, we can't just use curl -H \"Host: servername\" https://127.0.0.1/. This is because of SNI, we need to inform the server what hostname we are trying to access directly in the SSL handshake. As such, we need to do this: curl https://servername:443/ --resolve servername:443:127.0.0.1. This has been the source of a lot of pain.\n\nSecrets\nKubernetes has the notion of secrets, which are volumes meant to contain sensible data like encryption keys, certificates, account keys etc... They can be mounted in pods, and encrypted at rest.\nAdmission Controller\nIn kubernetes, admission controllers are controllers that try to authenticate calls to the kubernetes API. And some have deep ramifications in how things go on when they're defined. In our current setup, we only use one admission controller: the ServiceAccount controller. The ServiceAccount controller allows the administrator to define service accounts for pods to use when trying to access the kubernetes API. In particular, when this controller is defined, the apiserver automatically creates and mounts a default serviceaccount secret (per namespace) in every pod that is created, in /var/run/kubernetes/ This allows services that need access to the kubernetes API (ie: the DNS) to access the kubernetes API.\nSSL\nSSL is important when trying to do things securely. To this end, kubernetes allows communication to be in https rather than plain http. To this end we must define certificates to be used by the various components. In particular, we need 2 certificates : One that will act as a root CA that will be trusted on every node and pod  and one that will be the server's certificate. The root CA is mounted in every pod as a secret (thanks to the --root-ca flag of the controller manager) \nConfig Maps\nConfig maps are dynamic configuration that are mounted as files in pods.\nDaemon Sets\nA daemonset is a kubernetes object that will ensure that each node runs a copy of a pod. This is very useful for ceph, or a daemonized ingress controller.\n"},"chapter-deploy/Systemd_In_Kubernetes.html":{"url":"chapter-deploy/Systemd_In_Kubernetes.html","title":"Systemd In Kubernetes","keywords":"","body":"Systemd Containers on Kubernetes.\nThe Pause container is PID 1\nThis has already been described in another section.\nIf PID namespace sharing is enabled (it is by default), the pause process will get PID 1, and systemd will not start up. This is solved by giving the --disable-docker-shared-pid flag to the kubelet.\nFailed to change ownership of session keyring: Permission denied\nThis is an issue that plagued us for a long time so I'm going to go in depth into what it is and why it happened.\nContainers are different from VMs in that they run on the same kernel, and that is a limitation of the design (if they didn't they would be VMs, there's no way around it). As such, certain constructs that are kernel wide will be shared across containers. For instance the whole /sys filesystem, kernel modules, and in particular: kernel keyrings.\nKernel keyrings are a place to store user session secrets, like passwords etc... One component that actively makes use of the kernel keyrings is systemd. However, systemd in a container and systemd outside a container are two wildly different beasts. Systemd in a container is typically limited, especially if it isn't a privileged container. As such, any attempt to modify the keyring will be met with a \"permission denied\" error. So systemd attempting to touch keyrings will fail everytime and break the container...\nWell we know that's not true since we are able to run systemd in docker containers, so why can't we do the same with kubernetes containers? It's not like our docker containers were more privileged, in fact, they're even less privileged as they have seccomp rules active.\nAnd that is the main/only difference! Depending on what mechanism blocks the keyctl call, selinux, capabilities, seccomp, the return code of the syscall will be different. With SELinux and Capabilities, it's a rightful ENOPERM which means that systemd is not privileged enough to use keyrings. Systemd expects to be PID 1 and therefore the most root a root process could be, and therefore fails. However, when it is blocked by seccomp, it returns ENOSYS which could mean that the current kernel has no support for kernel keyrings. Well systemd is happy to oblige and will keep secrets somewhere else, since keyrings aren't supported on this kernel.\nNow the big issue with kubernetes at first glance is that seccomp doesn't appear to be supported ( https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/20870 ), but digging in the source code we quickly find the file pkg/security/podsecuritypolicy/seccomp/strategy.go which shows us that it is indeed supported. From there we can get staging/src/k8s.io/api/core/v1/annotation_key_constants.go which shows us that there is a tag seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod that can be applied on a pod to give it a seccomp profile, and finally we can get that v1.SeccompPodAnnotationKey: \"docker/default\" returns the default docker seccomp profile, which confines keyctl appropriately.\nsources : \n\nhttps://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7655\nhttps://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6281\n\n"},"chapter-deploy/Ansible.html":{"url":"chapter-deploy/Ansible.html","title":"Ansible","keywords":"","body":"Ansible in Cloudtrust\nIntroduction to ansible\nWe use ansible to almost an embarassing degree in order to make our deployments as fast, reliable, and useable as possible. To this end, it's important to be familiar with this tool.\nAnsible is simply a python wrapper over an ssh connection that will run tasks on an inventory of hosts. Tasks are typically modules, with parameters shaping what the module does. For instance the \"copy\" module can copy a file/dir from the ansible host to the ansible target.\nTasks are organized within roles, and are spread among multiple files to make things cleaner.\nRoles are run via playbooks which are the only thing (as far as cloudtrust is concerned) that ansible should interact with.\nAnsible in cloudtrust\nFor every component that's deployable there is a playbook. We try to unify the tags that are used in each playbook as build, deploy, and cleanup. \nWe will go over what the standard playbook do, and for that we will look at the keycloak playbook. The keycloak playbook simply runs the keycloak role, which runs tasks based on the given tags.\n\nbuild: Depending on the value of multiple vars, ansible will clone repos locally and run docker build on the keycloak dockerfile with appropriate arguments. Once the build is done, the image is saved into a tar archive.\ndeploy: Once the build step is done, deploy will push the tar to the target (every host in the inventory). It will also render and deploy keycloak templates for kubernetes resources. Namely a service, a deployment, an ingress, and a tls certificate.\ncleanup: Currently, cleanup only removes the locally cloned repository and the remote copy location. It has no effect on either the docker image or stuff instanciated in kubernetes.\n\nAnsible variables\nBuilds and deploys by their nature cannot be the same everytime everywhere, multiple environment will typically vary. For example a dev will have self-signed certificate but production will need an actual certificate. Passwords and other secrets will also vary from place to place, and we might like having the option to deploy something other than the tip of the dev branch.\nIn short, we need a way to customize deployments according to environments, and this is where variables come in.\nThere are variables defined at 4 different places, with different priorities, and different expected use.\n\ngroup_vars: These are the most global variables, they will be available from every role, and are typically for general \"state of the cluster\" type things, such as IP ranges, cluster name, etc...\nrole defaults: In the defaults folder of most roles, there are variables specific to that role set to appropriate settings. These typically include names, paths... These should not change that often as they don't relate to things that useful.\nrole vars: This is in the vars folder of some roles. This contains variables that are specific to that role and impact functional things. These typically include URLs for repositories, and commit hashes/versions. These win over role defaults if a variable is specified multiple times.\nextra vars: These add variables at runtime and are added to a playbook execution using -e. These are extremely specific use-cases that are added on a case-per-case basis, such as force which will force a docker image to be rebuilt without using cache, or docker_http_proxy which will add a proxy inside the docker service file.\n\nTo set environment specific variables, we have environment repositories, which contain the variables required for proper initialization. One such is the dev-config repository, which contains the dev configuration.\nAlong with role variables, these repositories can come with files (certificates, tokens...) that need to be deployed\nPreparing an environment for deployment is done via the config.yml playbook, which simply clones the repository (url and tag passed by extra var) and syncs its content, mainly role variables and role files.\n"},"chapter-deploy/Configs.html":{"url":"chapter-deploy/Configs.html","title":"Configurations","keywords":"","body":"Configurations\nWe manage our configurations in configuration repositories, which are simply a way to dump and version control our configs.

Its structure mimics the image to make what is deployed where as clear as possible .\ndeployable: Contains ansible variables for deploying the specific environment. Its structure mimics the ansible tree structure for similar reasons as above.\n\nThe root folder is for everything specific to that environment but that does not end up in the image or container, for instance credentials used by testing tools etc...\n"},"chapter-deploy/Telepresence.html":{"url":"chapter-deploy/Telepresence.html","title":"Telepresence","keywords":"","body":"Connecting to an existing cluster for devs\nWhen trying to develop a new service, it makes sense to try to connect it as if it were part of an existing cluster. But this requires rebuilding a docker image, writing a template file and creating the deployment, possibly disrupting the cluster and breaking everything.\nTo solve this issue, we invite you to look into telepresence (https://github.com/datawire/telepresence).\nTelepresence works by creating well crafted iptables rules, tied to a shell. Those rules will detect the cluster IP range and redirect every request sent to that range to a proxy that is instantiated cluster-side.\nFor DNS, the approach is to forward all dns requests back to the proxy, which will try to resolve them against the cluster dns. If it fails, it will instruct the client to redirect to one of the regular DNS.\n\nWarning Although telepresence can run docker images with the adjusted network, docker's --init argument is passed by default to the starting container. This creates a process before our entrypoint and gives it PID 1. Since our containers run PID 1, systemd fails to start and the container just hangs. To solve this issue, we must pass --init=false as an argument to telepresence when running. Doing so however is NOT guaranteed to work, as this essentially results in a call like docker run --init ... --init=false ..., which could fail depending on docker versions. Discussions are ongoing with datawire to change this behaviour.\n\nHow to configure to connect to the cluster\nTelepresence expects being able to call kubectl, for that to happen, the correct kubeconfig file needs to be passed to kubectl. Once this is done we can run telepresence --run-shell to get a shell \"in the cluster\".\nWith this shell, we can access cluster resources easily by using their Service names.\nSome quick kubectl commands to get you running:\nkubectl get --all-namespaces svc nslookup postgresql.default.svc.cloudtrust. The dns will by default try the domains \"default.svc.cloudtrust, svc.cloudtrust, and .cloudtrust\" so this means we can also run nslookup postgresql to get the same result.\nHowever, for services in another namespace, such as the dns itself, we need nslookup kube-dns.kube-addons.\nTo check the state of running deployments/pods, you can run kubectl get deployments or kubectl get po. For more information, there is also the kubectl describe po command (also works with deployments). If something seems wrong inside the cluster, kubectl exec $POD_NAME functions like a docker exec call, with similar options.\n"},"chapter-godevel/guideline.html":{"url":"chapter-godevel/guideline.html","title":"Guidelines","keywords":"","body":"Guidelines\nRecommended reading\n\nAn introduction de Go: https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/davecheney/introduction-to-go/introduction-to-go.slide#1\nGo reference: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html\n50 Shades of Go (Traps, Gotchas, and Common Mistakes for New Golang Devs): http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/\nGo design and philosophy: https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article\n\nIDE\nWe recommand VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux), but you are free to use any other IDE.

A typical Cloudtrust microservice will have at least logging, tracing, metric and error tracking middleware. Each of the middleware may be present 0 or more time per layer. For example in the flaki-service, there is a metric middleware at the endpoint, component and module level. This middleware tracks the response time of each level, so if there is performance issues or surprisingly slow response from the application, we can quickly pinpoint the source of the problem.\nAs it is common with go-kit microservices, the components are wired up in the main function. This is why Make...Middleware returns a function with the signature func(endpoint) endpoint. \nFor a middleware at transport level the signature will be func(grpc.Handler) grpc.Handler for gRPC, and func(http.Handler) http.Handlerfor HTTP.\nFor middleware at component and module level, the signature is func(next Service) Service, where Service is the interface that the service implements.\nBelow, there is an example of the middlewares at endpoint level.\nLogging\nThe logging middleware uses a go-kit JSON logger to log events. The logger is previously initialised with predefined key/value in the main function, i.e. MakeLoggingMiddleware(log.With(logger, \"time\", log.DefaultTimestampUTC, \"caller\", log.DefaultCaller \"middleware\", \"endpoint\", \"service\", ).\nEach call to log will log the previously defined key/values, as well as the new ones: correlation_id and took.\n// MakeLoggingMiddleware makes a logging middleware.\nfunc MakeLoggingMiddleware(logger log.Logger) endpoint.Middleware {\n    return func(next endpoint.Endpoint) endpoint.Endpoint {\n        return func(ctx context.Context, req interface{}) (interface{}, error) {\n            defer func(begin time.Time) {\n                logger.Log(\"correlation_id\", ctx.Value(\"correlation_id\").(string), \"took\", time.Since(begin))\n            }(time.Now())\n            return next(ctx, req)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nMetrics\nThe metric middleware tracks the duration of the operations at the different levels. The results are saved in an Influx DB time series database.\n// MakeMetricMiddleware makes a middleware that measure the endpoints response time and\n// send the metrics to influx DB.\nfunc MakeMetricMiddleware(h metrics.Histogram) endpoint.Middleware {\n    return func(next endpoint.Endpoint) endpoint.Endpoint {\n        return func(ctx context.Context, req interface{}) (interface{}, error) {\n            defer func(begin time.Time) {\n                h.With(\"correlation_id\", ctx.Value(\"correlation_id\").(string)).Observe(time.Since(begin).Seconds())\n            }(time.Now())\n            return next(ctx, req)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nTracing\nThe tracing middleware helps instrumenting the application by making traces.
